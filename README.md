# ColourSpace ZRO Patchsplitter
ColourSpace ZRO Patchsplitter is a lightweight, standalone tool designed for simplifying the process of importing patchlists made for ColourSpace to ColourSpace ZRO. It splits large patchlists into smaller files of 256 patches, ensuring compatibility with the ColourSpace ZRO license, which supports a maximum of 256 patches per file.

## Features
- Standalone portable application (no installation required).
- Automatically splits large patchlists into 256-patch segments.
- Leaves smaller patchlists (â‰¤256 patches) unchanged.
- The original files remain untouched. Only new split files are created.
- Compatible with .csv.txt files that were shared on AVSForum. No need to remove the .txt extension first.

## Usage
1. Run the application (double-click the .exe file).
2. Select the folder containing the patchlist .csv or .csv.txt files.
3. The tool automatically processes all patchlists larger than 256 patches, creating new .csv files as needed.
